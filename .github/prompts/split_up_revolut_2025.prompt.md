I changed my mind the revolut 2025 should be on its own doamin and convert the csv line in format 2025 into the crypto transaction, just like was done for the revolut 20222 format, this will be possible by having a service revolut2025 that take the csv lines from the csv file example 2025 and do whats necessary to transform those lines into crypto transaction, make sur to reuse the split concern of the revolut domain folder and redo thing quite similar to it, make sure that on the revolut 2022 domain there is no reference to the 2025 format anymore and move the test from 2025 to the revolut 2025 domain folder.
